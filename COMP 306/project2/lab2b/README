I have tried to add the #ifdef CHANGED and #endif around the parts that I have changed but I cant 
get it to compile.  I remember Peter K saying in the tutorial that if you forget it is not then 
end of the world.

I have changed basically every method, and have inculded my cvs diff or routing.c as proof.
