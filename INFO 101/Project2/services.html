      <h4><a name="newpc">1. New PC Assembly</a></h4>
      You can give a specification to our team of technicians, and they can build the computer 
      from scratch for you.  This means that you dont have to pay for things that you don't
      need, such as an operating system if you want to run Linux instead.  The technicians can
      advise you on the best choice of hardware for your individual needs.
      <br />
    
      <h4><a name="virus">2. Spyware/mallware and Virus Removal</a></h4>
      The internet is full of spyware/malware and viruses.  These pose a very real security risk.
      They could keep a track of keystrokes and therefore have access to your bank account or other
      secure sites, posing as you.  They also slow down the computer, by sending out information.
      These programs can dig themselves very deep into your computer and be very hard to completely
      get rid of once found.  Our team will 'steam clean' your computer to return it good-as-new.
      We will also install a firewall, anti-virus and anti-spyware software.  These can be freely
      tools or commercial software such as 
      <a href="http://www.symantec.com/index.htm">Norton Anti-virus</a>.
      <br />
    
      <h4><a name="software">3. General Software Installation</a></h4>
      Some software programs are quite hard to install and set-up so they work properly.  An example 
      of this is a tv tuner card, we will set it up so you will recieve a clear picture and be able
      to record programs for a small fee.<br/>
      All hardware needs drivers to make them work, and sometimes it is hard to get the correct drivers 
      to make the hardware function properly.  We will find and install the correct drivers to get
      you back 'up-and-running' again.
      <br />
    
      <h4><a name="hardware">4. Hardware Repairs</a></h4>
      If you have a perfectly fine peice of hardware that is a bit 'on the blink' or needs a bit of 
      a tune-up, bring it into us and we will perform magic wizardry to get it back as good as new for
      a small price.
      <br />
    
      <h4><a name="upgrade">5. Hardware Upgrades</a></h4>
      Our skilled team can perform quick hardware upgrades to increase the speed or usablility of
      your computer.  For details on the services we provide, see our
      <a href="products.html">products page</a>.  All our technicians are skilled in this area and
      your data is guaranteed to be returned untouched.
      <br />
