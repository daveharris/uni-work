      <h4><a name="ram">1. RAM</a></h4>
      <p class="center"><img src="images/ram.png"  alt="ram"/></p>
      The largest speed increase can be done by increasing the memory (or 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM">RAM</a>) size.  This is the place where programs are loaded,
      so with more RAM, more programs can be run at once, meaning faster loading times.  The boot-up time
      of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_System">operating system</a> can also be 
      dramatically reduced.
      Memory usually comes in the following sizes:
      <ul>
        <li>128MB</li>
        <li>256MB</li>
        <li>512MB</li>
        <li>1024MB/1GB</li>
      </ul>
      To run <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Microsoft Windows XP</a>,
      we recommend at least 512MB of RAM.  RAM can easily be upgraded and is relatively inexpensive.

      <h4><a name="hdd">2. Hard Disk</a></h4>
      <p class="center"><img src="images/hdd.png" alt="hdd" /></p>    
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hdd">Hard drives</a> are an integral part of the computer.  This saves 
      all your data and holds the data of the operating system.  Over the last few years hard drives have become 
      faster, which means that loading and boot times decrease.  The standard speed of the hard drive used to 
      5400RPM (Revs Per Min), but today 7200RPM is the norm.
      Hard drives usually come in the following sizes:
      <ul>
        <li>40GB</li>
        <li>60GB</li>
        <li>80GB</li>
        <li>120G</li>
      </ul>
      We recommend at least a 40GB drive, as Microsoft Windows will take up about 8-10GB over time, so that leave
      space for photos, movies etc.  Hard drive installation is straigt-forward.

      <h4><a name="cd">3. Optical Drive</a></h4>
      <p class="center"><img src="images/cd.png"  alt="cd"/></p>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_drive">Optical drives</a> are CD and DVD drives.  CD reader/writers
      usually came with new computers but today, DVD reader/writers are standard.  They allow you to read data 
      to install software, look at a friend's photos etc.  They can also be used to write data to disc, so that you have
      a backup of it if something happens to your hard drive.  The capacity of a CD is 700MB, while 4.7GB can fix on a DVD,
      so a DVD is a much better backup device.  The discs come in writable (writable only once, called a CD-R or DVD-R) or
      re-writable (able to be erased and writen again, called CD-RW or DVD-RW).<br/>
      Most current drives are able to read and write CD and DVD drives multiple times (if the correct discs are used).

      <h4><a name="monitor">4. Monitor</a></h4>
      <p class="center"><img src="images/monitor.png"  alt="monitor"/></p>      
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_display">Computer Monitors</a> show the output of the computer and
      enable you to interact with it.  In modern computers, the monitor is connected to a video card, which is controlled
      by the computer itself.  In recent years, LCD (or flat-panel) monitors have become cheaper and more popular.  They 
      give a clearer picture, give off less radiation and take up less space than a traditional CRT montitor.<br/>
      The resolution is the number of pixels on the screen.  The higher it is, the smaller the windows are and hence you 
      have a larger working area.  This also means that movies and pictures are of higher quality.<br/>
      The usual sizes and resolutions are shown below:
      <ul>
        <li>15", 800x600</li>
        <li>17", 1024x768 or 1280x1024</li>
        <li>19", 1280x1024</li>
      </ul>
