Question 1 and 2
The SortedArraySet was much much faster than the ArraySet class, especially when 
the amount of content in the files gets larger.  It was interesting to note that 
although courses-long is twice the courses-short, the program only takes a few 
more milliseconds to read the file.  The reason why the SortedArraySet is so 
much faster than the ArraySet is because it uses a binary search, rather than 
looking at each item in turn.  Thus it makes a huge difference to the overall
time for the program to run. On the smaller data file it runs 10 times faster 
than the ArraySet.  On the longest data file the binary search was almost 9 
times faster than the normal search.


Question 3
I think that if the length of the enrolments file was doubled, the time taken for the
SortedArraySet would still be about half of the time taken to the ArraySet.  In my sample data
above, for small files, the time taken for the SortedArraySet is half that of the ArraySet.
The time taken to do ArraySet would be twice that of normal, as it has to make twice as many calculations.
However, the time taken for SortedArraySet, would be much less than half, as the marginal time taken with a
binary search is no where near the same as the number of lines added.


Question 4
If the courses were multiples by 10, I don't think that it would really affect the time the time to run
the SortedArraySet.  As the short, long and longest are all double each other, the time taken
is basically the same.  Therefore, if the file was 10 times larger, the time would not change that much
compared to the original.  However the ArraySet is much much slower.  The time increases rapidly with the
additon of lines, and as the time taken between courses-short and courses-long is double, with about
double the lines.  The same thing ocours with courses-long and courses-longest, except that for double the
lines, the time is tripled.  Therefore when the files when multipled by 10, will take about twice as long 
as they normally do.
The reason the times are so different is because the cost of a binary search is O(log(n)) whereas the normal 
search is O(n).


Question 5
The only way to go is to use a binary search.  This speeds up the procees so much
and the code is not very difficult at all.  For the extra benefit of the time saving,
it is worth putting more time in to making the code more complicated.  Even though it
may take longer getting the code up and running, it would be worht the reward of
not having to wait as long on the spot.  The only difference between ArraySet and SortedArraySet is
the binary search, and it makes to program run twice as fast.  Even though the
enrolment file would be tripled in size, it wouldn't really make much of a
difference to the overall run-time.  However, the fact that if the array in
either Set class has to be doubled and all the elemnets copied in to the array
will take a long time if there are lost os data.  A vector would be good in
thris case as you just use the method addLast(), and you never need to copy the
elements over, the vector just grows to accomidate the addition of data.  this
would save time, and is easier to handle than an array of a fixed size.
