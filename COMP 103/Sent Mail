Amazing Math Problem

You'll need a calculator for this one!

 

Take the number of the month you were born, (March = 3, June = 6 etc.)

Multiply by 4,

Add 13,

Multiply by 25,

Subtract 200,

Add the day of the month on which you were born,

Multiply by 2,

Subtract 40,

Multiply by 50,

Add the last two digits of the year in which you were born,

Subtract 10,500.

Notice anything funny about your answer?

 

It's your date of birth!!

The month, the day, the year!

(this is a good one to use on people who lie about their age!)

Yes, it seems strange doesn't it? I will go and talk to the lecturerer about 
whether they recieved my submission.  I also seems strange that there are all 
the files in Assing06.Mon, but no files in .Tue or .Wed.  I submitted it at:
=== On Mon Sep 15 13:55:20 2003, with receipt number of 26842.
Your submission for comp103: Assignment 6 comprises the following files:

Caterpillar.java                                   Mon Sep 15 13:55:14 2003
compile-output                                     Mon Sep 15 13:55:20 2003
Caterpillar.class                                  Mon Sep 15 13:55:20 2003
As you can see I submitted at 1.55pm, and the file was last modified at 1.30.
It doesn't matter now, but thank you for your help with the porblem this far.  
Don't worry about it any further, as i now have Caterpillar.java in the .Mon 
dir.
Thanks 
David Harris

On Wednesday, I was in C0244.
I was on treehouse-cafe, kipp-cafe.
On Thursday when i logged in for the first time(and noticed that the 
Caterpillar.java was less than what i saved it as), i was on plum.

I noticed that the file was gone completeley on Wednesday last week, and was 
on vivo(or possibly on zest) in CO244 again.

Just a thought, would it be possible to get the Caterpillar.java file from the 
assignment submission place(I don't know much about the technical side of 
things!!).

Thanks for your help
David Harris

Hi,
My name is David Harris and i'm on State Opera.
While doing the last assignment, my file was saved in ~harrisdavi3/COMP 
103/Assig06 , and when i logged back in at a later date the file was not 
saved as far as i had saved it when i left.  I am sure of this because i 
compiled and ran it before i left (Java file).

Now the Caterpillar.java file has gone completely, and i can't find it 
anywhere.  It was saved on Monday when i submitted it, and the submission 
page has a record of this.

I am 100% sure that my file was both saved before i logged out, and I did not 
delete it. I was just wondering if you were doing some sort of change to the 
system.

Thank you,
David Harris
