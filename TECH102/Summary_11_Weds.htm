 <p align="left" class="style9"><strong> Images of anything &#13;</strong></p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> One can imagine making an image to display any data that varies from point to point in space.&#13;&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> For example, one might measure the temperature at points and displaying the data as a gray scale image with 0 C = black and 100 C = white. &#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> Or measure the water content of flesh and displaying that as a gray scale image with black = driest and white = wet. </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">Or


 measure magnetic field as a function of position and display gray scale with large fields as white, small as black. </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> Or determine the density of electrons is a material and display as a gray scale image with white = high density, black low. </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">Or 


 Measure the population density of a certain insect in a field and display as gray scale image with high density white, low black. &#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">Things like these examples are done reqularly. </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">&nbsp;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"><strong> Gray scale image for temperature&#13;</strong></p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> Computer monitors will only display 256 levels of gray and there's no point in displaying more than that as we learned when we studied the human eye. 


 But for data analysis I will want better resolution than 1/256. Here's an image of a circuit board in which whiter colours correspond to higher temperatures.</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"><img src="V__1.jpg" width="320" height="240"><strong><strong><strong><strong>&#13;</strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">Note:</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> There are no white dots on the chips. &#13;&#13;The board is green.&#13;&#13;White has nothing to do with colour – it's hot. </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">&nbsp;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"><strong>Higher Resolution<strong>&#13;</strong></strong></p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> Suppose I have more accurate thermal information. Suppose I have 12 bit data (4096 possible values). What then?&#13;My temperature resolution is now 100/4096 = 0.0244 C.&#13;&#13;For data analysis I will keep all that resolution, but for display on a computer screen I will compress to 8 bit data as follows: </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> 12 bit temp value 8 bit value&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">0 – 15: 0; 15-31: 1; 32-47 2; …&#13;4080-4095: 255 </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">False Colours: A Colour Palette</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> We can make our displays clearer by assigning RGB values to the 256 different levels of gray I am using for display?&#13;&#13;For example, suppose I took that image and displayed it with red for 256, blue for zero, and shades of gray between?&#13;&#13;Called a colour palette. Name this one Red Hot &#13;&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">The result is an image with false colour</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"><img src="V__2.jpg" width="320" height="240"> </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">&nbsp;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">Here's another example </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"><img src="V__3.jpg" width="320" height="240"><strong>&#13;</strong></p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> White very hot, red hot, green warm, blue cool</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">How do they do that?</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> An image is just an array of numbers that are interpreted as colours. &#13;&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> These images are 240x320 = 76800 array elements or pixels. &#13;&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> I could have used 76800 little thermometers to measure the temperature and then put the whole mess in an excel file. Then I could make an image from that data. &#13;&#13;But there's a better way as we shall see shortly. &#13;<strong>&#13;&#13;
