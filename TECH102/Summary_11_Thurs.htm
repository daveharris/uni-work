 <p align="center" class="style9"><strong>LECTURE NOTES </strong></p>
 <p align="center" class="style9">BlackBody Radiation and IR Cameras</p>
 <p align="center" class="style9">MORE DETAILED NOTES WILL BE POSTED MONDAY </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">Recall from previous lectures that light is an EM wave and that EM waves come in a wide range of frequencies. This part we call visible light is a small portion of the range. </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"><img src="EM.gif" width="626" height="101"></p>
 <p align="center" class="style9">&nbsp;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">An EM wave is made by wiggling (oscillating) charges. </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">But what makes charges wiggle to produce EM waves? </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> Technology: we drive a current in and out of antennas&#13;&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> Atoms: “wiggling” electrons produce EM waves at particular frequencies. Neon Red. Understood through the framework of Quantum Mechanics. &#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> But anything that is warm will have vibrating electrons and will produce EM waves. &#13;&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> In other words, anything warm will glow, although perhaps not with visible light.&#13;&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">&nbsp;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style11">How warm is warm enough?</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> Any object at a temperature higher than absolute zero (0 Kelvin = -273 C) produces electromagnetic radiation.&#13;&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> The hotter the object the more radiation it produces.&#13;&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> The hotter the object the higher the frequency of the most intense radiation. &#13;&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">&nbsp;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"><strong>BlackBody</strong></p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">A perfit absorber and perfect emitter of radiation is called a &quot;blackbody.&quot; </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">Real objects are often approximately blackbodies but absorb and emit a bit less radiation than a black body at the same temperature would. </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">&nbsp;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style11">Hot and Warm </p>
 <p align="left" class="style11"> Two black bodies at different temperatures:</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"><img src="BB.jpg" width="454" height="430"><strong>&#13;</strong></p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> Note that the hotter black body emits more light at each wavelength than the cooler object. &#13;&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> In total the hot black body emits far more light than the cool black body. &#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> <strong>Note K = C+273 </strong>&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> <strong>Stephan-Boltzmann Law </strong>&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">The total radiation (summed up over all wavelengths) emitted per square meter of surface on a hot object is.&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"><img src="equation.gif" width="529" height="58">&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"><img src="where.gif" width="387" height="42"></p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">The first term on the right is the emissivity of the object. It is one for blackbodies and often close to one for other objects. </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> <strong>Wien Displacement Law </strong>&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> Notice in the graph above that the wavelength of the maximum intensity is reduced as the temperature goes up, Or in other words, frequency goes up as temperature goes up. </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"><img src="wein.gif" width="448" height="58">&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">&nbsp;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> <strong>Cooler Objects Still Glow </strong>&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> But they do not produce enough visible light to see. Instead the produce IR, microwave, etc. &#13;&#13;You glow in the IR. &#13;So does an ice cube!&#13;&#13;By measuring your IR glow I can measure your temperature, although I also need to know your emissivity. For many objects I can assume the emissivity is near one. </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">Moreover, if I can see IR I can see you glow in the dark!&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"><strong>Infrared Ranges</strong></p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> Terminology varies, but the following is common: &#13;&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> Infrared means longer than visible (0.7 um) to 15 um </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> Near IR (meaning near visible) usually means 0.8 um – 1.7 um. An object at T=2400 K will peak at 1.2 um, and we detect this light to measure temperatures from 250 C – 1000 C </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> Midwave IR usually means 1.7 – 7 um. An object at &#13;T=960K peak at 3 um, detect this light to measure temperatures from 0 C – 350 C. </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> Long wave IR usually means 7 um – 15 um. &#13;&#13;Peak at 288 K, use to measure cryogenic temperatures.&#13;&#13;&#13;&#13;&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">&nbsp;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"><strong>An IR Camera </strong></p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"><img src="camera.gif" width="415" height="247">&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> An IR camera is really quite similar in many ways to a regular (visible light) digital video camera. </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> Lens focuses IR light onto detector as with visible camera. Lens made of material that appears black to keep out visible light. 


 The “retina” is still a bunch of light detectors (focal plane array) but sensitive to IR light.&#13;The pixels larger (at least one wavelength) and thus the cameras either have lower resolution or are larger. 


 For mid and longwave, have to cool the detector or it glows too much!&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"><strong>Clear as Glass?</strong></p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">Note that the lens often appears black or at least is not clear. How can this be? Materials can be transparent to some wavelengths but not others. For example, glass is transparent to visible light but opaque to uv and some IR. </p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">&nbsp;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"><strong>Some Example Applications</strong></p>
 <p align="left" class="style9">We saw images illustrating some of these</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> See through fog and smoke and air pollution &#13;&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> Monitor temperatures in industrial processes without trouching the object &#13;&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> See better inside the human body –see through blood to some extent &#13;&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> See warm objects such as people &#13;&#13;</p>
 <p align="left" class="style9"> Infrared astronomy &#13;&#13;</p>
