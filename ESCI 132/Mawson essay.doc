He established the Australasian Antarctic Expedition to undertake research in the 'Australian Quadrant', the area east of Cape Adare.  He set up two camps, the main base at Cape Denison and the second to the west, on the ice-barrier.  There were six separate expeditions that were all focused on gathering scientific data.  Mawson is primarily remembered for his remarkable survival against terrible odds, when both of his fellow explorers died, and lost most of his food.  He made it back, half-dead and had to wait another year before being rescued.}{\s25\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\par}

\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\li10\ri26\s25\itap0{\s25\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch Mawson was asked by both Scott and Amundsen to join their expeditions.  He was in lengthy talks with Scott about going on his expedition as a geologist.  Mawson rejected Scott's offer because Scott refused to allow him to explore the west coast of Cape Adare.  This location was chosen because it is closest to the magnetic South Pole.  This inspired Mawson to lead an expedition himself.  He called this the Australasian Antarctic Expedition.  He envisaged landing three teams on the ice to primarily undertake scientific research.  He contacted the Australian government for a grant, and was gifted half of the expedition's cost.  The ship Aurora sailed from Hobart on the 2nd December 1911 and arrived on the coast of Antarctica on the 8th January 1912 after a relatively uneventful journey.  Before reaching the coast, a five-man radio station on Macquarie Island was built.  This was used as a relay station to Australia in being first wireless radio from Antarctica.}{\s25\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\par}

What he didn't know when building the hut was that the Katabatic winds were funneled into this very location.  He later called this the 'Home of the Blizzard' with wind speeds reaching over 300km/h.  This forced them to build a cave, which they named Aladdin's Cave.  It was situated five miles from the hut and was used as a refuge to escape the gales.  Mawson said this of the cave; "We decided to excavate a cavern in the ice under the surface of the glacier, for such a refuge from a hurricane would be a great service to all future sledging parties... Inside the silence was profound, the blizzard was banished.  Aladdin's cave it was henceforth called - truly magical world of glassy facets and scintillating crystals ... The place, in fact, was simply replete with conveniences.  We thoroughly enjoyed the night's rest in Aladdin's Cave, notwithstanding alarming cracks proceeding occasionally from the crevasses around."}{\s25\f0\fs20\super\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\chftn}{\footnote

R.E.P monoplane with skis.  It was intended to be used as a tractor, but it had crashed in Adelaide during a promotional flight which damaged the wings.  However, it was brought to Antarctica anyway, Mawson thinking that it may be used as an 'air-tractor'.  Bickerton, a very able mechanic got the engine running well, after having to adapt it to run with very thick oil due to the freezing temperature.  It was going well, if only too slowly when suddenly the engine froze with such force that the propeller snapped.  It was abandoned about ten miles from the base, and later taken back to Cape Denison.}{\s25\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\par}

The Southern Party was tasked with research involving gravity in the vicinity of the South Magnetic Pole.  A supporting team was sent to help, but had to return to Cape Denison by the end of November 1911.  The Western Party was to examine he coastal highlands to the west.  They were to employ the air-tractor.  Two teams were to explore the coastline to the east.  A far eastern party with dogs was to map distant sections of the eastern coast.  Mawson decided that he would lead this team, and take Ninnis and Mertz with him.  The parties all left together on the 17th November 1911, and when they reached Aladdin's Cave they split up into the separate parties.}{\s25\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\par}

Overall, the three-man party made good time with good weather, but encountered a few days of bad weather where they could not leave the tent.  The first disaster struck on the afternoon of 14th December, when they had reached their furthest pint and where turning homewards. As Mawson notes, everything was fine; "The dogs rose to the occasion and pulled eagerly and well.  Everything was for once in harmony and the time was at hand when we should turn our faces homewards."  At this point they decided to abandon one of the sledge to save weight.}{\s25\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\par}

Mertz, a very competent skier was skiing well ahead of the dogs to give them a trail to follow.  Behind him was first Mawson and then Ninnis on the sledges.  As the last member of a dog-sledging caravan is usually the safest, Ninnis had most of the essential gear on his sledge.  He held his ski pole up in the air, signaling something unusual, possibly danger.  Crevasses were not expected on the smooth surface they were on, but Mawson was unsure what Mertz was signaling at.  When Mawson reached the spot marked by Mertz, he saw no irregularity and rode aboard the sledge over the point and stopped on the far side.  He then proceeded to take out his log-book and calculate their current latitude.}{\s25\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\par}

\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\ri152\s25\itap0{\s25\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch He looked back at Ninnis and noticed the faint indication of a crevasse.  "It was but one of many hundred similar ones we had crossed and had no special dangerous appearance".  He warned Ninnis of the crevasse and saw that Ninnis changed his heading so that he crossed the snow lid at right angles, and not diagonally, as Mawson had done.  Mawson then turned back to his calculations, not giving Ninnis a second thought.}{\s25\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\par}

I remember addressing myself to George, the laziest dog in my team, saying 'You will be getting a bit of that too, George, if you are not careful.'  When I next looked back, it was in response to the anxious gaze of Mertz who had turned around and halted in his tracks.  Behind me, nothing met the eye but my own sledge tracks running back in the distance.}{\s25\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\par}

There was no such fortune however, for I came to the gaping hole in the surface about eleven feet wide.

All Mawson could see about 150 feet below, on a shelf, were two dogs, the tent and the canvas food tank.  They were carrying alpine rope, but it was not long enough to reach to the bottom.  They continued to call down until nine o'clock at night, when finally Mawson read the Burial Service.  Ninnis fell in because he was walking beside the sledge, not riding on it as Mawson had done.  Not only had they lost Ninnis, but of the gear as well.  In total they lost the tent, some clothing, all of the dog food and half of the human food.  They were in dire straits, and they still had three hundred and fifteen miles to go!}{\s25\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\par}

In such moments, action is the only tolerable thing...  Stricken dumb with the pity and heavy at heart, we turned out minds mechanically to what lay nearest at hand."  The bad situation was made worse by the fact that no deposits were laid down, so they had nothing between them and Winter Quarters.  The problem now was the lack of shelter.  They created a tent out of a spare tent-cover, Mertz's skis and the abandoned sledge parts.  They started eating the dogs for food, but most it went to the surviving dogs.  What meat they did have was "tough, stringy and without a vestige of fat".  They tried to make the meat more appetizing but chopping it up finely and mixing it with pemmican, brought to the boil in a large pot of water.  They were forced to kill the last dog on 28 December.}{\s25\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\par}

\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\li10\ri26\s25\itap0{\s25\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch On the 1st of January 1913, Mawson noticed that Mertz was not his usual self, but the weather was very bad so they decided to stay in the tent.  Mertz complained of pains in his abdomen.  Mawson had a constant gnawing sensation in his stomach and put Mertz's illness down to a more acute form of his own condition.  Then Mertz expressed a sudden dislike to biscuit, and a desire for the small remaining amount of Glaxo.  On   4 January, the weather was fine, but Mertz was feeling unwell and he wanted to rest.  As the sky was overcast on the 5th, and Mertz decided that it would be better if they camped yet another day.}{\s25\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\par}

After much anguish, Mertz resorted to riding on the sledge.  He though he was in full contact with the wind but was doing no physical work, and they only covered 2 miles before they had to stop and make camp.  Mawson could see that Mertz was holding him up, and he may not make it.  He said "If only I could get on; but I must stop for Xavier [Mertz].  He does not appear to be improving and both our chances are going now."  Mertz was not only suffering from starvation and dysentery, but was having fits.}{\s25\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\par}

Mawson pondered his journey ahead.  Mawson had his own medical problems as well.  The "gnawing sensation in my stomach had developed into a permanent weakness...  Several of my toes commenced to blacken and fester near the tips and the nails worked loose".  There has been some speculation as to whether Mawson practiced cannibalism at this point.  Mawson again read the Burial Service, the second in three weeks.}{\s25\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\par}

He cut his sledge in half with his pocket-knife and sewed a makeshift sail and carried on.  On 11 January, Mawson set out, but soon had to stop due to sore feet.  He examined them to find to his horror that "the thickened skin on the soles had separated in each case as a complete layer, and abundant watery fluid had escaped into the socks.  The new skins underneath was very abraded and raw".  He applied lanoline to the soles of his feet and bandaged up his feet the best he could.  On 13 January, he found his feet were in even worse condition, but he could do nothing more. }{\s25\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\par}

He fell right through the lid of a second crevasse.  He was roped to his sledge, but was fourteen feet below the lip and pulling the sledge down on top of him.  He thought it was the end.  He thought of all the wasted uneaten food in the sledge, and remarkably manged somehow to create knots in the rope and haul himself to the top.  With all his weight now on the snow-lid again, it gave way, and he fell, the rope catching him again, fourteen feet below.  There, looking down into the deep, dark chasm he momentarily thought of suicide, \uc1\u8220\'93[where] all the pain and toil would be over\uc1\u8221\'94.  He decided against it, and fought his way to the top where he lay completely exhausted.  He constructed a rope ladder, to help him climb out of crevasses while wondering how all this would end.

Mawson had no doubts that it was constructed by a search party.  He found on top of the cairn was  a bag of food, directions and distance to Aladdin's Cave, and a note saying that Amundsen had reached the pole first.

Mawson eventually made it to the cave, where he found more food.  He was not home safe yet however.  There were still five miles of steeply sloped ice down to the hut at the shore line.  Just as he was about to leave, a wild storm blew up, which lasted for a whole week.

They recalled the ship with the new-fangled wireless radio, but it was too stormy to return.
