\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\s30\itap0{\s30\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch To retrieve the radioactive probe we would consider sending a diver or a mini-submarine (depending on the circumstances).  The diver would be less harmful to the environment as a smaller hole would need to be cut in the ice, and the mini-sub would require special equipment and a generator.  It could also introduce foreign materials into the water.  The equipment would be stored at McMurdo base as it would have the equipment and personnel needed.  The New Zealand is solely responsible for the clean-up and the cost of this clean-up.  The cable manufacturers could also the held liable if the cable was within the specified safe working limits.  An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) would have to be done, so there will be contingency plans to deal with such accidents.}{\s30\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\s30\itap0{\s30\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch We would retrieve the vibracorer, but as the batteries are sealed it is not urgent.  The seals will eventually be eroded away, so a crane ship shall be called for.  We would attempt to do perform this operation in summer, when the sea ice has melted.  The environmental damage to the environment as a whole would outway calling a ship especially, but if a ship that is already scheduled to come anyway, we can do it then.  USA, NZ, UK and Italy all pay the percentage of the total cost of the clean-up in the same proportion that they are funding the project.  The cable manufacturers could also the held liable if the cable was within the specified safe working limits.

\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\s30\itap0{\s30\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch We would have to clean up the oil spill.  There are spill kits at McMurdo base and the Italians also have some.  No-one is liable under international law, but the international community would come to aid the US in the clean-up and worry about how to cover the cost later.  The liability for an accident may be written into the contract between the shipping company and NSF.  The way to avoid such a disaster would be to have ice-strengthened or double hulls.  Diplomatic pressure could be put on the flag state of the ship.  As the ship is flagged to a non-treaty country, the international community can not force them to do anything.}{\s30\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\s30\itap0{\s30\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch The rubbish should be removed from McMurdo, as under environmental protocol.  This should be done very carefully so as to minimize the environmental effect of uncovering the rubbish.  Harmful gasses or water may leech out of the rubbish and cause havoc elsewhere.  This should be done in stages, so to minimize this.  Professional rubbish contractors should brought in, with the emphasis on environmental cleanliness.  Not much special equipment is needed, with bulldozers etc already at McMurdo.  The US is liable for the payment of removal of rubbish.  There are no ways to avoid liability, as it is already there.  The international community can make sure that the US is being environmentally responsible.  They would also have to complete a EIA.}{\s30\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
