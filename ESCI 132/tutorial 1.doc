\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\s30\itap0{\s30\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch A recurring reason why people themselves want to visit Antarctica is because they see it as the last unconquered frontier in the universe, some likening it to the moon.  They both have a very hostile environment, they are very hard to get to and from and not many people are able to go there.  A part of this is also the need for people to explore places where not many people have been and stamp their mark on the world.  Many people also sighted the wildlife a large factor in why they want to visit.  As many people were doing geography majors, many people talked about the interesting geology of the area.}{\s30\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\par}

\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\s30\itap0{\s30\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch One of the most mentioned reasons for going to Antarctica was to see the scenery in person.  The plant life was also mentioned because only a few plants can adapt to live in such a  cold, windy and dry environment.  Penguins, seals and other animals was also a large factor in why people go to Antarctica.}{\s30\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\par}

\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\s30\itap0{\s30\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch The issue of tourism in Antarctica was very clear cut.  We all thought that tourism should go ahead, but with very strict regulations.  We thought that the tourism operators should apply for some sort of permit, and a high cost would prohibit smaller operators without clear operating procedures from gaining access to the continent.  The point was made however with such a large amount of coast, it would near impossible to police such regulations.}{\s30\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\par}

There was some concern however that rich people may go down there just to say that they have been there and to get a photo with a penguin.  Nobody wanted to see the development of cities or major roads because, the lack of such things is one of the major attractions of the place.  Also wealthy people are more likely to donate towards the protection effort if they have experienced it themselves.  It also raises the awareness of the plight of Antarctic climate change and how fragile the climate of the planet is.}{\s30\f0\fs22\lang5129{\*\listtag0}\par}
